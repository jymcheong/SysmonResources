# Threat Hunting with Sysmon

* [https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/ThreatHunter-Playbook](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/ThreatHunter-Playbook) A Threat hunter's playbook to aid the development of techniques and hypothesis for hunting campaigns by leveraging Sysmon and Windows Events logs. This project will provide specific chains of events exclusively at the host level so that you can take them and develop logic to deploy queries or alerts in your preferred tool or format such as Splunk, ELK, Sigma, GrayLog etc. This repo will follow the structure of the [MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org) which categorizes post-compromise adversary behavior in tactical groups. In addition, it will provide information about hunting tools/platforms developed by the infosec community for testing and enterprise-wide hunting.
